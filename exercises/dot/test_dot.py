"""
In this exercise we want to test two testing concepts that can
be tricky:

1. testing where the numerical result is inexact, and we need
   to check that the result is approximately as expected with
   certain precision.

2. testing where we want to check that the code actually raises
   an error if the conditions are wrong. We don't want the
   tests to crash, quite the opposite: the tests must return
   success when the code reports and error, and return failure
   when the code does not report an error or reports an error
   of an unexpected type.

Finish the test functions below according to their docstrings.
